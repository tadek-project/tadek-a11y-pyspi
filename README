TADEK - Test Automation in a Distributed Environment
====================================================

TADEK is a novel approach to automatic testing and remote control
of applications over accessibility and similar technologies.

The main goals of the environment are:
 * Providing a means for quality assurance of every project, even on a small
   scale
 * Simple and rapid test implementation, with no change to the application code,
   in order to minimize the extra costs of QA
 * Unified extensibility for provision of one common interface to many access
   technologies
 * Maintainability for re-using the same test cases on different projects and
   platforms
 * Flexibility to integrate with other systems, such as continuous integration
